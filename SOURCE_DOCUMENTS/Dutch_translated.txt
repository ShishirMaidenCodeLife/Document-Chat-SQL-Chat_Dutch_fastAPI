How nice to finally write to you again. I haven't seen you for a long time. I live in Amsterdam now. I live in a small house with my girlfriend. Next to my house is a football field. There I football every Saturday together with a few friends. I made new friends at the football club. They are called Aman and Jan. Jan is eighteen years old and also lives in Amsterdam. Aman is the older brother of Jan. The Netherlands likes me very much. The only disadvantage is that it rains quite often.
are very nice and always helpful. Learning the Dutch language is going well. Only the grammar I find difficult. I've already learned many new words. How are you doing in Germany? How are you doing at your new school? Let me know what it's like in Germany!
